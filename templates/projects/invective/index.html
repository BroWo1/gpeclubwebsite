				<h1 align="middle" style="padding-top: 50px">Usage Circumstance</h1>
				<p style="padding-top:25px">
                    When using the rhetorical device of invective, we need to pay attention to the correct circumstances of using it.
                    <br><br>1. <span class="highlight1">Use invective when using pathos</span>. Pathos is the appeal to the audience’s emotions. And by using invective, we can trigger the audience’s emotion of feeling angry. Therefore, we can make the message we deliver more impactful to the audience and thus help us to better deliver our following messages too.
                    <br><br>2. <span class="highlight1">Use invective when attacking</span>. When we persuade our opponent and their idea, we can use invective to attack the opponent. Because of the invective’s strong emotional appeal, it can help us to influence the audience’s idea against the opponent’s when used effectively. Remember to be careful with our logos, because invective is more emotional than logical.
                    <br><br>3. <span class="highlight1">Use invective when mobilizing</span>. Sometimes, we want to trigger the audience to have a sense of identity that aligns with us, different from the opponent. By using invective effectively, we can distinguish our standing point from the opponent, creating patriotism within the audience. Hence making the audience feel aligned with us and other audiences.

                <h1 align="middle" style="padding-top: 50px">Real-life Examples</h1>
				<p style="padding-top:25px; padding-bottom: 25px">
                    Example 1:
                    <br><br>In Donald Trump’s 2020 presidential campaign, he often refers to his opponent, Joe Biden as “Sleepy Joe”. For example, on April 25, 2019, Trump tweeted a message that said, “Welcome to the race, Sleepy Joe”.
                    <br><br>In this tweet, using invective, Trump called the other presidential candidate Biden “Sleepy Joe” to humiliate and attack him. By effectively using invective, Trump can evoke concern in the audience, the voters, about Biden’s age, thus diminishing his credibility. This causes the audience to question whether is Biden really “sleepy” because of his old age and cannot handle the job of president effectively as Trump. Moreover, by using the nickname “Sleepy Joe” often in his campaign, Trump can group his supporters to also attack Biden using this nickname,
                    triggering their emotions of sarcasm at Biden and making them align with the choice of voting for Trump as the president.

                </div>
                <p style="padding-top:25px; padding-bottom: 25px">
                    Example 2:
                    <br><br>In ABC's 2024 presidential debate, when arguing about illegal immigrants with presidential candidate Kamala Harris, presidential candidate Donald Trump said: “In Springfield, they are eating the dogs. The people that came in, they are eating the cats. They’re eating – they are eating the pets of the people that live there.”
                    <br><br>In this sentence, using invective, Trump attacks the illegal immigrants by claiming they are “eating cats and dogs”. By effectively using invective to make a false claim about the illegal immigrants’ shocking and negative actions, Trump can dehumanize them and make the audience attack the illegal immigrants, furthermore questioning Harris’ political view about illegal immigrants in the US.
                    Because how eating cats and dogs is beyond the moral standards of the audience, Trump’s attack can create a negative view of illegal immigrants in the audience, therefore letting the audience support his negative view of illegal immigrants and against Harris’ positive view of them.

                    If used correctly, invective is a powerful and effective rhetorical device that is mainly used when appealing to pathos. But still, if used ineffectively in incorrect circumstances, invective may oppositely damage your argument. Below are some tips that need to be remembered when using invective:
                    <br><br>1. Be careful with logos and ethos. Invective could damage your logical reasoning and your credibility when used.
                    <br>2. Balance between abuse and respect. Overly using invective may severely disrespect your opponent.
                    <br>3. Use with consideration. Invective is far more complicated than simply humiliating your opponent, so be mind utilizing it thoughtfully.
